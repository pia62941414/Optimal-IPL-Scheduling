# Optimal-IPL-Scheduling
INTRODUCTION
Professional Sports League are big businesses around the world.
One key to such an income level is the schedule team plays. No right holder wants to pay large sums only to get unattractive teams playing on a prime date. Teams do not want to see their large investment in players and infrastructure undermined by poor scheduling. Fans, who ultimately provide the income for the leagues, are also greatly affected by the schedules.
In addition, travels become an important issue for the team. Teams are also concerned with the more traditional issues with regards to their home and away patterns. No teams like to be away more than two weeks or so, nor do teams want to be home for longer than that period.
From above, we can clearly see that the major problem is to schedule the matches in order to reduce travels for teams. This problem can be solved by the combination of Double round robin tournament and Travelling salesman problem.

PROBLEM DEFINITION:
Here as an example, we have taken IPL. There are many constraints such that every team plays with others twice, one on its own home town and another on the opponent home town.  As we all know that of double round robin in IPL suffer from being too long to complete and hence required a lot of days to get over resulting in higher expenses of travelling, staying etc and hence we are trying to balance travel distance and breaks, while satisfying more requirements and making profit for the organization by higher attendance and TV viewership, lower costs and increased fairness
